# Sales Forecast & Analysis - FP&A Modeling Project

This repository contains a fully built **time-series forecasting and
business analysis model** designed to support executive-level
decision-making for revenue planning. The project demonstrates my
ability to translate raw transactional data into structured financial
insights, develop predictive models, and present results in a clear,
business-ready format.

The model is packaged in the file:\
**`Sales Forecast & Analysis.xlsx`**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a forecasting engagement for a restaurant concept
("Vintage Restaurant"). The file includes:

-   **Time Series Analysis**\
    Uses historical monthly sales to build time-based predictors and
    seasonal factors.

-   **Model Development & Explanation**\
    A structured analytical workflow demonstrating:

    -   Trend identification\
    -   Regression modeling\
    -   Seasonality adjustments\
    -   Variance interpretation\
    -   Accuracy evaluation

-   **Forecast Output & Monthly Comparison**\
    A forward-looking sales projection paired with month-over-month and
    year-over-year comparisons.

The goal is to showcase an end-to-end FP&A process---from data cleaning
to forecasting to executive reporting.


## 📈 What This Model Demonstrates

### 1. Financial Modeling & Forecasting

-   Built a predictive framework using:
    -   Linear trend modeling\
    -   Seasonal multipliers (Jan--Dec factors)\
    -   Model evaluation metrics (R², MAPE, etc.)
-   Forecast supports:
    -   Revenue planning\
    -   Budgeting cycles\
    -   Sensitivity and variance analysis

### 2. Structured Analytical Thinking

The workbook clearly separates: - The **cover page** and business
context\
- The **analytical engine** (Time Series sheet)\
- The **logic layer** (Model & Details sheet)\
- The **presentation results** (Jan Comparison & visual summaries)

This mirrors how FP&A teams structure multi-layer models to ensure
traceability, clarity, and auditability.

### 3. Executive-Ready Reporting

The final outputs highlight: - Forecast vs. actual comparisons\
- Variance explanations\
- Seasonality patterns\
- Clean charts suitable for executive presentation


## 🔧 Technical Skills Demonstrated

  Skill               Application in This Project
  **Excel Modeling**  Multistep regression framework, seasonality modeling,
                      forecast construction

  **FP&A              Trend/seasonality decomposition, variance analysis
  Forecasting**       

  **Data Cleaning &   Working with raw historical sales and converting to
  Structuring**       modeling-ready format

  **Business          Translating data patterns into operational and financial
  Analysis**          insight

  **Visualization**   Executive-ready comparisons and charts


## 🧠 Key Insights From the Model

-   Sales follow a clear **seasonal pattern**, with monthly multipliers
    quantified.
-   Trend analysis indicates a consistent directional shift, informing
    budget setting.
-   The model separates **trend vs. seasonality effects**, enabling
    scenario planning.
-   The forecasting structure can be easily extended to:
    -   New locations\
    -   Multi-channel revenue streams\
    -   Cost forecasting\
    -   Margin projections


## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

This workbook reflects how I approach FP&A problems in real-life
scenarios:

-   Build structure before analysis\
-   Validate assumptions\
-   Break complexity into modular components\
-   Present outputs that influence decisions

The goal is not just to generate a number---but to create a transparent,
adaptable forecasting system that leadership can rely on.
